Particularly with a view to future generations, there is no way around a circular economy modelled on nature. That is why we aim to take only as much out of the economic, ecological and social cycle as we can put back into it elsewhere. Being a company that is oriented towards the common good is a fundamental prerequisite to enable us to do our part to secure the future of the environment and the world around us."},{"heading":"Companies with ownership responsibility","imageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dhpk1grmy/image/upload/v1613462458/About%20Company/tyuovxzud91slmyagbl9.jpg","text":"Since the company’s success depends equally on all employees, elobau asked itself why only one person should own the company. A far-reaching transformation process followed the simple answer: the transfer of the company into responsible ownership. With this model, the core idea of the social market economy can be freely pursued without having to submit to the harsh rules of investor capitalism; the company now belongs to itself.\nAll employees benefit equally from the advantages of the Purpose Enterprise. The enterprise works for itself and uses the profits for itself - it cannot be sold off."},{"heading":"5 achievements of which we are particularly proud","imageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dhpk1grmy/image/upload/v1613465691/About%20Company/srhpadqixvyyqigko2rc.jpg","text":"Sustainability is the cornerstone of our vision and mission statement. We can now look back on 10 years of sustainability at elobau. We are particularly proud of these 5 achievements: since 2009, we have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1-3 according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) by 34%. With the help of our PV systems, we generate more electricity than we consume. Therefore, we produce 100% with green electricity. We offset unavoidable emissions with reforestation projects in Costa Rica, which is why our Scope 1-3 production has been climate-neutral since 2010. In total, our employees have already circumnavigated the globe 31 times by driving green kilometres. \nWe look forward to making the world a little more sustainable every day."}]},"completedCompanyActions":[{"contentId":"offsetEmissions","description":null,"id":"offsetEmissions_-MJgJ_1sE839Y27z8MOe","requirements":[{"contentId":"investCarbonOffsets","description":null,"id":"offsetEmissions_investCarbonOffsets_-MJgJ_1sE839Y27z8MOe","title":"Invest into carbon offsets"}],"title":"Remove carbon emissions that you can‘t reduce "},{"contentId":"completeClimateNeutrality","description":"Note: you need to work with a third party to calculate Scope 3 emissions and get this badge.\n\nEven if you’re not ready yet to commit to offsetting your extended footprint, it’s worth measuring it regularly and tracking changes.
