This project aims to avoid 30,0006 ha of deforestation which equates to 14,507,808 tonnes of CO2e in emissions reductions over the 30 year project lifetime.\n\nThe preservation and protection of this project area will protect its biodiversity, maintaining habitats for the species that live within the forests. A total of 158 different tree species were surveyed within the project bounds, and it is known to host eight endangered mammal species and numerous endangered bird and plant species. The detailed management of the forest will also mean the continued employment of nearly 400 workers within the region."},{"heading":"SUSTAINABLE CLIMATE SOLUTION ","imageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dhpk1grmy/image/upload/v1616515469/About%20Company/gmoxgvwybgxonpdgp9io.png","text":"This Wind Power Project in Andhra Pradesh, developed by Orange Anantapur Wind Power Pvt Ltd, involves the installation and running  of 50 wind turbines. The total installed capacity of the project activity is 100 MW comprising 50 wind turbines of 2000 kW capacity each. \n\nThe purpose of the project is to generate electrical power using wind energy, which is then exported to the Indian electricity grid, displacing electricity which would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels, such as the coal mines. When it is fully operational, the project will be responsible for around 200,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions reductions each year.\n\nThis project will also help alleviate poverty within the local area, by creating employment opportunities for local people and bringing additional investment to the region. Power generated from this project activity can also be used for small scale industries, thus further generating more, and alternative, employment opportunities."},{"heading":"BIODEGRADABLE COLLECTION ","imageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dhpk1grmy/image/upload/v1616511029/About%20Company/qp4wpak6dpk7s8oxvwm7.png","text":"We asked ourselves how we could get out of this situation of wasting more and more resources and growing mountains of discarded clothes - and decided to create our own small collection.
