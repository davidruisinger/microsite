These targets can be externally verified by signing up to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) which is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Understanding your carbon impact across your full value chain will be a key part of setting your target. This must extend to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.\n\nEvery quarter, plan specific OKRs or KPIs to implement some climate-positive actions, such as initiatives that you can find in the current action plan. Set the process to measure your footprint quarterly to track dynamics and make the right decisions. \n\nIn addition, __you can use an environmental management system (EMS)__ to systematically set targets and monitor progress. It measures the impact of your business (input, output, and everything in between), identifies areas and assets that have a significant impact, assigns a point score to each, and creates a list of targets to work toward.

External input might be required if your in-house capability is limited. \n\n1. Start by identifying areas of conflict, or potential conflict, between your core business model and factors of potentially negative environmental impact (e.g. production of or reliance on fossil fuels or other finite resources). \n2. For each conflict, review ways in which the negative impact identified could be altered to become positive. In many cases this will require some radically creative thinking and a workshop environment.\n3. Facilitation by an outside expert could be useful. For example: If your company manufactures washing machine components, and you identify that your (finite) raw input material is likely to become scarcer (therefore more expensive) over the next 10 - 20 years, you could consider a move to a leasing model whereby you retain ownership of the component, lease it to your customer, and recover it for remanufacturing or reuse after it has reached end of life. \n4. It is vital to identify where your business has the biggest carbon impact. These departments should then be considered a priority.
