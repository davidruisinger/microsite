External input might be required if your in-house capability is limited. \n\n1. Start by identifying areas of conflict, or potential conflict, between your core business model and factors of potentially negative environmental impact (e.g. production of or reliance on fossil fuels or other finite resources). \n2. For each conflict, review ways in which the negative impact identified could be altered to become positive. In many cases this will require some radically creative thinking and a workshop environment.\n3. Facilitation by an outside expert could be useful. For example: If your company manufactures washing machine components, and you identify that your (finite) raw input material is likely to become scarcer (therefore more expensive) over the next 10 - 20 years, you could consider a move to a leasing model whereby you retain ownership of the component, lease it to your customer, and recover it for remanufacturing or reuse after it has reached end of life. \n4. It is vital to identify where your business has the biggest carbon impact. These departments should then be considered a priority. Remember, your biggest impact could be outside of your head office.","id":"sustainableManagement_transformBusinessModel_-M1_5OGeQws_zBccGfdO","title":"Business model transformation"}],"title":"Develop sustainable management principles "}],"programId":"lfcaPledge","programName":"LFCA Pledge"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"-M1_5OGeQws_zBccGfdO","slug":"/e/nwb-verlag"}},
