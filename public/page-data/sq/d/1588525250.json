Since these cloud servers are shared amongst many companies and often developed by high-tech companies, they reach an energy efficiency, that is 5-6x higher than traditional on-premise services.

It would basically require separate transportation and cables for “your” electricity and losses of energy along the way. So instead, your energy provider buys green electricity on the energy markets on your behalf. If you want to run your home on actual green energy, the best way to do so is to build up your own little energy park (solar, wind) in your garden. The same principle applies to the data center and cloud providers around the world.

Google is the only cloud provider that is committed to reaching 24x7 renewable energy (Stage 3) for all of their data centers and even developed a framework to reach that goal. Since most alternative \\\"green\\\" hosting services are still connected to their local energy net and do not have the efficiency of a big cloud provider, as well as the monetary resources to invest into their own wind- or solarparks, it is very likely that the Google Cloud has a significantly lower footprint than any of these services.
